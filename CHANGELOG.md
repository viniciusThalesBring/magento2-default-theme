## [Unreleased]

[Unreleased]: https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/compare/1.1.8...main

## [1.1.8] - 2021-09-24

[1.1.8]: https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/compare/1.1.7...1.1.8

### Added

- **Add estimate shipping form to cart page**

  More details can be found via the [issue #147](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/issues/147).

- **Add customer account update email checkbox**

  The customer account edit form was previously missing this checkbox.

  Thank you to Josh Cairney @ Swarming Technology (@joshcairney) for the contribution.

- **Add container on cart page for custom product type options**

  This container allows rendering additional options for cart line items.  
  More details can be found in the [commit 029d2b](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/commit/029d2b4ff46675feccf3038790485a2b8d593f2c).

- **Add Date-of-Birth form field template with datepicker**

  Thanks to Alex Galdin @ integer_net (@alexgaldin) for the contribution!

- **Add additional information container to cart page**

  The container is rendered below the coupon form field on the cart page.
  More details can be found in the [commit 097918](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/commit/097918837faa6f3faeecb744123d1c166e32adcb).

- **Add container to totals on cart page to render custom totals**

  The container is rendered below the existing totals but before the grand total.
  More details can be found in the [commit 58f447](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/commit/58f4475a4bff85315cd8ef26e8e86fb4e04038e9).

- **Allow setting css classes on generic slider**

  If a value is set for the property `maybe_purged_tailwind_section_classes` on block class rendering the slider, it
  will be used as the container class="" attribute value. If the property is not set, the previous value is used,
  meaning this is a backward compatible change.

  More details can be found in [merge request #246](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/merge_requests/264).

### Changed

- **Bugfix: Escape product review gql mutation payload values**

  More information about this backward compatible change can be found in the
  [commit ff9095](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/commit/ff9095ed535a64c8861de82400a14e000adf102a)

- **Bugfix: Fix issues with old Safari browser**

  Details on backward compatible change can be found in the [merge request #261](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/merge_requests/261)

  Thank you to Guus Portegies @ Cees en Co (@gjportegies) for the contribution!

- **Bugfix: Make Google Analytics compatible with Magento_GoogleTagManager**

  Previously Google Analytics revenue data was not collected on the frontend order success page on Adobe Commerce.

  Thanks to Jesse de Boer @ Elgentos (@jesse) for investigating!

- **Bugfix: Align subtotal excl. tax value on cart page to the right like the other total modals**

- **Split mobile and desktop menu into separate .phtml files**

  Decoupling the two makes customizing one of the views possible without influencing the other menu.  
  The change is backward compatible.

- **Update TailwindCSS to the latest version**

  The version constraint in the package.json is now set to `2.2.9`.  
  This is a backward compatible change.

- **Apply Logo Dimensions set in the Adminhtml Theme Configuration**

  Previously the logo height and width set in the admin theme config where not applied.
  As long as there is no size configured on the theme, the previous dimensions set in layout XML are still used.

  More details can be found in the [issue #221](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/issues/221).

  Thanks to Tomas Kalasz @ CS2 (@TKalasz) for investigating and to Ravinder @ redChamps (@rav-redchamps) for the patch!

### Removed

- **Removed topmenu_static.phtml template**

  The template is now part of the hyva-ui repository.


## [1.1.7] - 2021-08-25

### Added

- nothing

### Changed

- **Bugfix: Remove trailing space in customer prefix option values**

  See [commit](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/commit/c2c6009daaf6048e2725a0e2f98e5604f202bb76)

  Thanks to Daniel Galla (IMI)!

- **Bugfix: Allow authentication-popup to be resubmitted**

  In the authentication popup (when guest checkout is disabled), once incorrect information is entered and the form is submitted, the submit button is “disabled” and re-submitting with the correct information is not possible.

  See issue [#214](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/issues/214)

### Removed

- nothing

[1.1.7]: https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/compare/1.1.6...1.1.7


## [1.1.6] - 2021-08-12
_Version 1.1.6 of the Hyva_Theme module is required for this update_

### Critical
- **Fix for: Subtotals break if address set without shipping method**

  In some edge cases an address could be set on a quote item without a shipping method. This would break the cart total display.
  If default behaviour to quote shipping address is changed, for instance by a third-party module, where an address is set on the quote by default, but no shipping method, this would break the cart instantly.
  
  A direct patch/diff for this issue can be downloaded from commit [`9a78264f` diff](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/commit/9a78264f8726b3120e60e5f9222b36bb1fdeef63.diff)

  See commit [`9a78264f`](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/commit/9a78264f8726b3120e60e5f9222b36bb1fdeef63).


- **Page columns layout refactored from flex to grids**
  
  For a more solid handling of `2columns-right` and `3columns`, the page layout was refactored to CSS grids.
  This means all pages now have 'containered' content by default, since the `.columns` div now has the tailwind `container` class applied.
  
  If you want to build custom pages that are full-width, you now need to define your own page-layout. This means when you're creating custom pages, you no longer need to add in containers on all blocks you add, making layouts more consistent.

  The changes were made in `web/tailwind/components/structure.css` and require you to remove the extra wrapper container we previously introduced in `Magento_Theme/page_layout/override/base/2columns-left.xml`.
  These changes can be viewed in commit [`54c7f6d5`](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/commit/54c7f6d5f2c0ed109e611eb4cb196e453794a31a).
  
  In existing projects, you might end up with double margins on containers after this change.
  We would advise to either:
  1. remove extra containers you added in your content
  2. in case you don't want to update your existing content, keep the previous version of the files `Magento_Theme/page_layout/override/base/2columns-left.xml` and `web/tailwind/components/structure.css` in your child-theme.
    

### Added
- **The current page is recalculated when toggling limiter in toolbar**

  In `Magento_Catalog/templates/product/list/toolbar.phtml`, the active page is now recalculated when you switch the limiter in the toolbar. This change reflects an update in Magento core that was introduced in version 2.4.0.

  See commit [`db90fc6a`](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/commit/db90fc6a9de433e560c7b23826390dc62e9a44e2)

- **Regions now work as expected on customer account address forms**

  See commit [`78f144fe`](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/commit/78f144fe7c7ae6130507095c8632403b834b911a)


- **A lot of A11Y changed were made**
    - Button focus styles are improved (using Tailwind `ring` classes)
    - Removed nested `<nav>` and `<footer>` elements
    - header search icon had empty ref, changed to button
    - header search was missing submit button
    - header customer account had no focus state
    - PLP toolbar now has logical tab order
    - Swatches are now visibly focusable
    - "skip header" link was missing
    - Sliders now have a focus-within border when focused
    
  See [Issue `#204`](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/issues/204), [Issue `#205`](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/issues/205) and related Merge requests.

  Thanks to Clever Age for reporting.
  
  _NB: if you report other A11Y issues to us we'd be happy to address them_


- **Cart error messages are improved**
  
  General error messages in the cart are now styled (because they are now rendered by the global messages component).
  Cart-items that contain errors now show these errors in-line.
  
  This requires an update of the `hyva-themes/magento2-theme-module` to version 1.1.6.

  See all commits in [Merge Request `!249`](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/merge_requests/249).

### Changed
- **Fix for invalid aria-label on PDP swatches**

  `aria-labelledby="radiogroup-label"` was removed on the swatch render container div.

  See `Magento_Swatches/templates/product/view/renderer.phtml` and commit (`8970a96a`)[https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/commit/8970a96adca6195012196b06550d11d50c7bd9a3]

  Thanks to Hitesh Koshti (Ontapgroup) for contributing.


- **Fix for activeSelectOptions on Bundled product Radio options**

  Previously, when a radio option's quantity on a bundle product was set to user defined, the activeSelectOptions were improperly defined and the quantity input fields did not have their value or state properly set. The value got set to 0 and this negatively impacted the price calculation as well.
  Additionally, if the radio bundle option is required, there was no change binding on the "None" field.

  See `Magento_Bundle/templates/catalog/product/view/type/bundle/option/radio.phtml` and commit [`dd51fdfb`](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/commit/dd51fdfbdbb237851d917e0a3e4b69913cb83ffc)

  Thanks to Josh Cairney (Swarming Tech) for contributing.


- **Fixed issue where Cart items qty input fields have no label on cart page**

  The cartItem quantity change input field now has a label for screenreaders

  See `Magento_Checkout/templates/cart/items.phtml`
  
  Thanks to Hitesh Koshti (Ontapgroup) for contributing. 


- **Customer Login legends are now consistently styled**

  The form titles/legends for customer login and account registration are now consistently styled

  Thanks to Hitesh Koshti (Ontapgroup) for contributing.


- **Fix for bundled product Radio/Select if only one option present**

  When either the radio or select is a single option the user defined checkbox did not take effect which disables the qty input.

  See commit [`a3aaf192`](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/commit/a3aaf1929b4af173f604b0604b20bc4ae166fc14)

  Thanks to Ryan Hissey (Aware Digital) for contributing.


- **Bundled product qtyHelper method is now defined in parent component**

  The `qtyHelper` methods that memorize bundle option quantities selected by vistitors is now no longer generated for all bundle option, but defined once in the `initBundleOptions` component.

  See commit [`7d452495`](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/commit/7d45249514b04aabc26868218df4e257ccb30abc)

  Thanks to Ryan Hissey (Aware Digital) for contributing.


- **Cart display of totals and coupon are improved**

  We've refactored how cart subtotals look.

  See commit [`e4efe6cc`](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/commit/e4efe6ccd6298906995abf6abb17cda2b1102df4) or related issue with screenshots [`#195`](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/issues/195)


- **Fix re-definition of `category.view.container` in layout xml**

  In `Magento_Catalog/layout/catalog_category_view.xml`, the `category.view.container` is no longer redefined.

  See commit [`3ce5c6c1`](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/commit/3ce5c6c1414d759ac263b9ddf18dc8030309ae17#3937fe081bbe3ab4df39105d411f910f6d2347b6)

  Thanks to John Hughes (Fisheye) for contributing


- **The `category.product.list.additional` has moved to `Magento_Catalog/layout/catalog_category_view.xml`**

  Thanks to Nathan Day (Fisheye) for contributing


- **The Checkout button in cart is no longer disabled on error**

  The state of the cart can change by changing quantities in the cart.
  Clicking "Proceed to Checkout" performs a serverside validation of the cart and will return back at the cart in case the cart is still invalid.

  An example is "Minimum order amount". If the minimum is not met, it will show a warning. If you would increase the quantity of an item so that the minimum is met, the message disappears. Validation takes place again when you continue to checkout.

  See commit [`1d5747d8`](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/commit/1d5747d8e5cf7ccc29cf465dd7b89e47e8fede14)


- **The product sections renderer `trim on boolean` error is fixed**

  The following error would occur:
  TypeError: trim() expects parameter 1 to be string, bool given in `Magento_Catalog/templates/product/view/sections/product-sections.phtml`
  
  See commit [`e1459009`](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/commit/e14590093054b9cf0058f0c5df6cffee4bbccf9f)

  Thanks to Victor Chiriac (Magecheck) for reporting

### Removed
- none

[1.1.6]: https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/compare/1.1.4...1.1.6


## [1.1.5] - version number SKIPPED
- 1.1.5 was skipped in order to stay in sync with `hyva-themes/magento2-theme-module`

## [1.1.4] - 2021-06-16
_Version 1.1.4 of the Hyva_Theme module is required for this update_

### Added
- **A Dispatch event that is triggered after accepting cookies**

  After accepting cookies `window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('user-allowed-save-cookie'));` is now being triggered.

  In the Hyva_Theme module (v1.1.4) cookies are not stored until this event is triggered.

  See `Magento_Cookie/templates/notices.phtml`

  Thanks to Mirko Cesaro (Bitbull) for contributing

- **Initial active gallery image now defaults to 0 if no main image set**
  
  If no main image is set, the initial active image is now set to `0`.
  
  See `Magento_Catalog/templates/product/view/gallery.phtml`

  Thanks to Simon Sprankel (CustomGento) for contributing

- **In customer account area, sales items are now showing child-items**
  
  See `Magento_Sales/templates/order/invoice/items.phtml`, `Magento_Sales/templates/order/items.phtml` and commit [`72751505`](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/commit/72751505ed80a86987adf9eca3834a2369f7295c)

- **Customer account sales now show prices including tax**
  
  The layout file at `Magento_Tax/layout/sales_order_item_price.xml` was added, which adds tax to sales items in customer account, when needed.

- **Add-to-cart button on PDP has its original ID back**
  
  The add-to-cart button now contains `id="product-addtocart-button"` again, as it does in core Magento. This would help frontend testing frameworks in functioning.
  
  See `Magento_Catalog/templates/product/view/addtocart.phtml`

  Thanks to Laura Folco for contributing

- **Switching configurable options now dispatches an event**
  
  The event `configurable-selection-changed` is now dispatched from `Magento_ConfigurableProduct/templates/product/view/type/options/js/configurable-options.phtml`

  This allows you to hook into this event in 3rd party modules or custom code.

  Thanks to Simon Sprankel (CustomGento) for contributing

- **A generic slider template was added**
  
  `Magento_Theme/templates/elements/slider-generic.phtml` was added. Hyva_Theme module version 1.1.4 or higher is needed to use the generic slider.
  
  Please refer to `Rendering Sliders` in the Hyvä Documentation for full details on how to use the generic slider.

- **Out of stock swatches are now shown**
  
  Out of stock swatches are now implemented on PLP and PDP.
  Also, the phtml that renders swatches is consolidated to a single file: `Magento_Swatches/templates/product/swatch-item.phtml`
  Same goes for swatch tooltips: `Magento_Swatches/templates/product/tooltip.phtml`
  
  See commit [`fd3f3aa3`](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/commit/fd3f3aa35baf415efb1ea885ff2ee71c6c5376ae)

- **Email To Friend Button was added to PDP**

  The EmailToFried/SendFriend button has been added to the Product Detail Page.

  See commit [`a5211128 `](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/commit/a521112806aaf7c88fa4c94b3ff21901dcd4a58f)


### Changed
- **Product List items are now cached in block_html cache**

  This reduces cost for products with swatches, as they are loaded for
  each product individually and not as part of the product collection.

  See `Magento_Catalog/templates/product/list.phtml`
  
- **Top Menu now uses generic template block with viewmodel cache tags**

  Now that the Navigation View Model uses getIdentities() we can set the cache_tags on the topmenu and properly cache the menu in Full Page Cache.
  
  See `Magento_Theme/templates/html/header/topmenu.phtml` and commit [`6736ae66`](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/commit/6736ae66dc13cee9f5d612f2c1342e40f80b28b1)


- **PLP Titles have been reintroduced and Styled**
  
  We no longer remove the title in `Magento_Catalog/layout/catalog_category_view.xml`.

  Beside that, the titles are restyled a bit overall.

  Thanks to Rich Jones (Aware Digital) for contributing

- **Swatch options now correctly return `label` before `value`**

  See `Magento_Swatches/templates/product/js/swatch-options.phtml`

  Thanks to Rich Jones (Aware Digital) for contributing

- **Swatch labels are now properly closed with </label>**

  See `Magento_Swatches/templates/product/view/renderer.phtml`

  Thanks to Rich Jones (Aware Digital) for contributing

- **Product Description is now rendering Directives properly**

  `$productViewModel->productAttributeHtml()` is now used to render product descriptions. That means variables in `{{directives}}` are now rendered.
  
  See `Magento_Catalog/templates/product/view/description.phtml`

- **An empty product description no longer renders the parent element on PDP**
  
  See `Magento_Catalog/templates/product/product-detail-page.phtml`

  Thanks to Victor Chiriac (Mage Check) for contributing.

- **Additional product data on PDP is now rendered with a renderer**

  As in default Magento (Luma), additional data is now rendered with a renderer (`Magento_Catalog/templates/product/view/product-sections.phtml`) which allows you to change the display of these sections to a custom implementation.
  This makes it a lot easier to implement a tabbed display or accordeon. It also enables you to render additional data from 3rd party modules using the standard Magento layout group:
  ```
  <block class="Magento\Catalog\Block\Product\View\Attributes" template="Magento_Catalog::product/view/description.phtml" group="detailed_info"/>
  ```
  
  See 
  - `Magento_Catalog/layout/catalog_product_view.xml` and files in `Magento_Catalog/templates/product/view/sections/`
  - or all commits in [`Merge Request 201`](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/merge_requests/201)

- **Customer account registration pages are no longer cached**

  If any error occured during customer signup & customer was being redirected back to the registration form with error message. But the form data would not be preserved due to full-page caching.

  `cacheable="false"` has now been added to the `customer_form_register` block.

  See `Magento_Customer/layout/customer_account_create.xml`
  
  Thanks to Ravinder (redMonks/redChamps) for contributing

- **Shopping assistance checkbox has been added to registration form**

  See `Magento_Customer/templates/form/register.phtml` and `Magento_LoginAsCustomerAssistance/layout/customer_account_create.xml`

  Thanks to Ravinder (redMonks/redChamps) for contributing

- **Logo image size variables are now correct**
  
  In `Magento_Theme/layout/default.xml` the variables `logo_img_width` and `logo_img_height` were renamed to `logo_width` and `logo_height`
  This changed in 2.3.5+ in Magento Core.
  
  Thanks to Guus Portegies (Cees en Co) for reporting

- **The checkout url in de minicart/cart-drawer changed**

  `checkout/index` was changed to `checkout`, which normally renders the same page/url. But, some 3rd party extensions (such as Mageplaza_OneStepCheckout) replace the `checkout` url to alter the path to a checkout page.
  
  See `Magento_Theme/templates/html/cart/cart-drawer.phtml`

- **Empty cart continue shopping now links to homepage**

  Previously, this linked back to the cart.

  Thanks to Daniel Galla (iMi) for contributing

### Removed
- **Standard Quantity field is no longer shown on Grouped products**
  
  See `Magento_Catalog/templates/product/view/quantity.phtml`

  Thanks to Rich Jones (Aware Digital) for contributing

- **Pagination was removed from customer account order print**

  See `Magento_Sales/layout/sales_order_print.xml`

- **Aria labelledby has been removed from PLP swatch-items**

  `aria-labelledby="radiogroup-label"` was causing LightHouse best practice warnings and thus has been removed.

  See `Magento_Swatches/templates/product/listing/renderer.phtml`
  
  Thanks to Hitesh Koshti (On Tap) for contributing

[1.1.4]: https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/compare/1.1.3...1.1.4

## [1.1.3] - 2021-05-07
_Version 1.1.3 of the Hyva_Theme module is required for this update_

### Added
- none

### Changed
- **Pass product instance to price view model instead of relying on internal state**

  This improves reusability of templates and allows changing the order in which they are rendered.

### Removed
- none

[1.1.3]: https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/compare/1.1.2...1.1.3

## [1.1.2] - 2021-05-03
_Version 1.1.2 of the Hyva_Theme module is required for this update_

### Added
- **Added `clear-messages` event to the messages-component**
  
  Messages from the messages component can now be cleared with an event that removes all messages in `Magento_Theme/templates/messages.phtml`  

  Can be used as `window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('clear-messages'));`

- **Select template for custom-options**

  Custom options of the type `dropdown` and `multiple` are now rendered by a .pthml file, instead of using `\Magento\Catalog\Block\Product\View\Options\Type\Select\Multiple::_toHtml`
  A new viewModel and method were created for this: `\Hyva\Theme\ViewModel\CustomOption::getOptionHtml`

  This viewModel renders `Magento_Catalog/templates/product/composte/fieldset/options/view/multiple.phtml` (new) or `Magento_Catalog/templates/product/composite/fieldset/options/view/checkable.phtml` (existing).

- **Custom options are added for Bundled products**

  Turns out, when `dynamic pricing` is disabled, bundled products can have custom options. Who knew? We didn't.
  So now, bundled products contain custom options.
  
  This means that mostly extra logic was added to pricing at `Magento_Bundle/templates/catalog/product/view/price.phtml`

  Also the container `product_info_bundle_options_top` was *re-added* from core Magento and `product_info_bundle_options_bottom` was newly created.

### Changed
- **Added robots.txt file back to layout**

  See `Magento_Sitemap/layout/robots_index_index.xml`

  Thanks to Rik Willems (RedKiwi) for contributing.

- **Fix hardcoded required company field on customer account**

  See `Magento_Customer/templates/widget/company.phtml`
  
  Thanks to Aad Mathijssen (Isaac) for contributing.

- **Fix hardcoded required region field on customer account**

  See `Magento_Customer/templates/address/edit.phtml`

  Thanks to Aad Mathijssen (Isaac) for contributing.

- **Replaced removeEventListener with `{ once: true }` on addEventListener**

  See `Magento_ReCaptchaFrontendUi/templates/js/script_loader.phtml`:
  `document.body.addEventListener("input", loadRecaptchaScript, { once: true });`

  Thanks to Javier Villanueva (Media Lounge) for contributing.

- **FIX: reload customerData in cart after applying coupon code** 

  See `Magento_Checkout/templates/cart/js/cart.phtml`

- **Fix: don't show PLP Swatches for attributes with getUsedInProductListing disabled**

  See `Magento_Swatches/templates/product/listing/renderer.phtml`

- **Swatch display improvements**
    - set height and width on all non-text swatches
    - use swatch value and fall back to swatch label
    - hide image container in tooltip if no image/color available
    - add whitespace-nowrap to swatch and tooltip text
  
  See commit [`2ebc7a5c`](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/commit/2ebc7a5c41b2c888cbbf551dd42907763ae24c43)

- **Added .editorconfig for unified whitespace handling

  See `.editorconfig`
  
  Thanks to Sean van Zuidam (Mooore) for reporting.

- **Added initActive event to gallery that activates the main image**

  Previously, the first image in the image list would show as initial image.
  Now, the `main image` is activated on load.
  
  See `Magento_Catalog/templates/product/view/gallery.phtml`

  Thanks to Rik Willems (RedKiwi) for contributing.

- **Fix price calculation for bundled tier prices**

  Previously, the tierPrice price-reduction was calculated, instead of adding the result price.

  See `Magento_Bundle/templates/catalog/product/view/price.phtml`

  Thanks to Gautier Masdupuy (Diglin) for reporting.

- **Change item qty change event to input event in cart**

  Previously, cart item quantity changes in the cart were triggered `onBlur`, this was changed to `onInput`.
  This results in quicker feedback. Changes are still debounced with 1 second:
  `x-on:input.debounce.1000="mutateItemQty(item.id, $event.target.value);"`

- **Quality improvements on the cart page**
    - Direct customerData retrieval from localStorage was removed and replace with the `private-content-loaded` event only.
    - Replaced $this instances combined with `function(){}` for ES6 arrow functions and `this`
    - Added error feedback to `fetch()` methods, report errors to console and show general error message to visitors
    - Report 

- **Fix adding multiple select options to wishlist**
  
  Selected product options (custom, configurable, bundle and grouped) of the type `select-multiple` are now properly sent to the wishlist.

  See `Magento_Catalog/templates/product/view/addtowishlist.phtml`

  Thanks to Gautier Masdupuy (Diglin) for reporting.

- **Fix price calculation for bundled options**

  A bug was introduced in 1.1.1 that removed x-ref from bundle-option input fields, replacing then with   
  `document.querySelector(option[data-option-id="${optionId}-${selectionId}"]`

  Two issues occured:
  - not all inputs had the `data-option-id` attribute
  - not all inputs are of the type `option`

  The querySelector was changed to `[data-option-id="${optionId}-${selectionId}"]` and the attribute was added to the missing option types

  See `Magento_Bundle/templates/catalog/product/view/type/bundle/options.phtml` and `Magento_Bundle/templates/catalog/product/view/type/bundle/option/*.phtml`

- **Only validate 1 option for custom option checkboxes**
  
  Thanks to Hrvoje Jurišić (Favicode) for reporting.

- **Calculate product final price when configuring a product in cart with custom options**

  Previously, when editing a product in the cart, the product final price was only updated after changing custom options.
  Now, already selected options are properly selected when loading the configure cart-product page.

  See `initSelectedOptions` in `Magento_Catalog/templates/product/view/options/options.phtml`

- **Fix uploading new custom option file**

  Previously when editing a product in the cart with an uploaded custom-option-file, a new file would not be uploaded.
  Now, the value `save_new` is properly set on the hidden file-field.
  
  See `Magento_Catalog/templates/product/view/options/type/file.phtml`

- **Styling of bundled options was improved on smaller viewports**
  
  Mostly: input fields would break out of the containing columns because of the browsers default min-width value of `<fieldset>`
  
  See `Magento_Catalog/templates/product/view/options/wrapper/bottom.phtml`, `Magento_Bundle/templates/catalog/product/view/summary.phtml` and `Magento_Bundle/templates/catalog/product/view/type/bundle/options.phtml`

- **Escaping of additional attributes was removed to allow html to be rendered**

  Thanks to Vinai Kopp for contributing.

- **PDP prices are overhauled to respect all tax-settings**

  Tax display was inconsistent, mostly when selecting `catalog prices include tax` and `display product page prices excluding tax`.

  Price retrieval was refactored into a viewModel in `Hyva_Theme`: `\Hyva\Theme\ViewModel\ProductPrice`.
  This applies to:
  - Product price
  - custom options
  - tier prices
  - bundle options

  See commit [`61b3f1a0`](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/commit/61b3f1a0fd557657d4de4103340772dff3893d5e)

### Removed
- `Hyva_Theme/templates/js/localStorageConfig.phtml`

  The file `localStorageConfig.phtml` was removed, since it is an anti-pattern to retrieve customerData from localStorage directly.
  Instead the `private-content-loaded` event should be used. Please refer to the documentation for more information on the `private-content-loaded` mechanism.

[1.1.2]: https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/compare/1.1.1...1.1.2

## [1.1.1] - 2021-04-08
### Added
- none
### Changed
- **Resolved issues with Configurables/Swatches:**
    - Empty swatches now render correctly
    - Dropdown attributes now render correctly with Swatches enabled. Therefore `Magento_ConfigurableProduct/templates/product/view/options/configurable.phtml` needed to be moved to `Magento_ConfigurableProduct/templates/product/view/type/options/configurable.phtml`
    - `initConfigurableOptions_{product_id}()` changed to `initConfigurableDropdownOptions_{product_id}()` in order to add `$block->getJsonConfig()` in a `<script>` block instead passing it through the `x-data=` attribute.
    - PLPs no longer try to render non-swatch attributes
    
   Thanks to Antonio Carboni (Magenio) for reporting
    
Please refer to [1.1.1] for all diff changes 

### Removed
- none

[1.1.1]: https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/compare/1.1.0...1.1.1

## [1.1.0] - 2021-04-02
### Added
- **Compare products sidebar added**
  
  Thanks to Timon de Groot and Sean van Zuidam (Mooore) for contributing.

- **Product Attributes listing added**
  
  The `product.attributes` was added to product detail pages, which list all available attributes for a product (as an addition to the 'featured attributes' listed on top of PDPs).  

  Thanks to Sean van Zuidam (Mooore) for contributing.
  
- **In Product Listings, price and image can now be updated**
  
  To support swatches on PLPs, the price and image can now be updated with events:
  `update-gallery-<?= (int)$productId ?>` and `update-prices-<?= (int)$productId ?>`
  
  See `Magento_Catalog/templates/product/list/item.phtml`

- **Empty checkout now shows message**
  
  If no checkout installed, a message is now being shown.
  
  See `Magento_Checkout/layout/checkout_index_index.xml`

- **Checkout registration now works**
  
  After checkout, the registration option is now shown.
  
  See `Magento_Checkout/templates/registration.phtml`
  
  Thanks to Vincent Marmiesse (PH2M) for contributing.

- **A footer column container was introduced**

  A wrapper column for the footer was added `Magento_Theme::html/footer/column.phtml`
  
  See `Magento_Directory/layout/default.xml` for usage.

- **Login as customer is now fully compatible**
  
  The default login as customer from the admin area now works, including the customer-account-area toggle to allow accounts to be controlled by store-owners.

  See `/Magento_LoginAsCustomerFrontendUi/`
  
  Thanks to Barry vd. Heuvel (Fruitcake) for contributing.  
  
- **Currency switchers were added**
  
  The footer now loads a currency switcher.
  
  See `Magento_Directory/layout/default.xml` and `Magento_Directory/templates/currency.phtml`
  
- **Store and Language switchers were added**
  
  The footer now loads a store and language switcher, if required.
  
  See `Magento_Store/layout/default.xml`, `Magento_Store/templates/switch/languages.phtml` and `Magento_Store/templates/switch/stores.phtml`

- **Configurable swatches were added**
  
  Swatches are now loaded on PLP and PDP pages. The swatches in layered navigation were already present but are now better styled and include tooltips.
  
  See `/Magento_Swatches/` for all changes.
  
  An important new pattern is the extension of already existing Alpine Components by merging/extending the initObjects.
  As present in `Magento_Swatches/templates/product/view/renderer.phtml`:
  
  ```
      <?= $block->getChildHtml('options_configurable_js') ?>
      <?= $block->getChildHtml('options_swatch_js') ?>
  
      <script>
          function initConfigurableSwatchOptions_<?= (int) $productId ?>() {
              const configurableOptionsComponent = initConfigurableOptions(
                  '<?= (int) $productId ?>',
                  <?= /* @noEscape */ $block->getJsonConfig() ?>
              );
              const swatchOptionsComponent = initSwatchOptions(
                  <?= /* @noEscape */ $block->getJsonSwatchConfig() ?>
              );
  
              // here we merge `configurableOptionsComponent` with `swatchOptionsComponent`
              return Object.assign(
                  configurableOptionsComponent,
                  swatchOptionsComponent
              );
          }
      </script>

  ```
- **Default Footer links were added**
  
  A static phtml file was added to load common footer links.
  
  See `Magento_Theme/layout/default.xml` and `Magento_Theme/templates/html/footer/links.phtml`
### Changed
- **Improved bundle option performance**
  
  On bundled products with large amount of options, `x-ref` used excessively in a loop caused performance issues.
  These were refactored to `document.querySelector()` and `document.getElementById()` lookups.
  
  See `Magento_Bundle/templates/catalog/product/view/type/bundle/options.phtml` and https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/issues/93
  
  Thanks to Gautier Masdupuy (Diglin) for reporting.

- **product.info.options.wrapper was reintroduced**
  
  https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/issues/117
  
  For compatibility with 3rd party modules / extensibility.
  See `Magento_Catalog/layout/catalog_product_view.xml`
  
  Thanks to Laura Folco for reporting.
  
- **Limiter and ViewMode in toolbar no longer break layout when empty**
  
  The Limiter and ViewMode now render empty containers to prevent the layout from breaking when they are disabled.
  
  Thanks to Judith Demets (Storefront) for contributing

- **Alt and Title fallbacks are added to the PDP image gallery**
  
  See `Magento_Catalog/templates/product/view/gallery.phtml`
  
  Thanks to Aad Mathijssen (Isaac) for contributing.

- **Tax display on PDP is now correct**
  
  https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/-/issues/115
  
  Previously, if catalog prices were excluding tax but displayed with tax, the tax would not be added correctly.
  
  Thanks to Antonio Carboni (Magenio) for reporting

- **Configurable prices now show 'as low as' until all options selected**
  
  See `Magento_Catalog/templates/product/view/price.phtml`
  
  Thanks to Konrad Langenberg (imi) for contributing.

- **min and max screenheight values are better named**
  
  Previously, `min-height: 50vh` was declared as `min-h-50`, this has been changed to `min-h-screen-50`.
  
  See `web/tailwind/tailwind.config.js`
  
  Please check your codebase for any instance of `min-h-{25,50,75}` as well as `max-h-{25,50,75}` and replace with `min-h-screen-X` and `max-h-screen-X` values. 

  Thanks to Sean Zuidam (Mooore) for reporting

- **Cart shipping totals now display correctly**

  See `Magento_Checkout/templates/cart/totals.phtml`
  
  Thanks to Victor Chiriac (Mage Check) for contributing.

- **Alpine Component JS for Configruable options moved to child block**
  
  In order to make `initConfigurableOptions()` reusable and extendable, it was moved into `Magento_ConfigurableProduct::product/view/options/js/configurable-options.phtml`

  This was needed for integration of Configurable Swatches without duplication of a large amount of JavaScript code.
  
  See `Magento_ConfigurableProduct/layout/catalog_product_view_type_configurable.xml`, `Magento_ConfigurableProduct/templates/product/view/options/configurable.phtml` and `Magento_ConfigurableProduct/templates/product/view/options/js/configurable-options.phtml`.

- **Customer account edit page password error message moved**
  
  for better layout stability, the structure of `Magento_Customer/templates/form/edit.phtml` changed to prevent layout shifts.

- **Customer menu in header now respects `isAllowed` setting for account registration**
  
  See `Magento_Customer/templates/header/customer-menu.phtml`
  
  Thanks to Barry vd. Heuvel (Fruitcake) for contributing.
  
- **Customer account edit prefix field now respects `isPrefixRequired` setting**
  
  Thanks to Philipp Neuteufel (Limesoda) for reporting.  

- **Footer newsletter subscription styled more consistently**
  
  The footer newsletter form is now styled more in line with the rest of the layout.

- **PDP reviews now take current storeview in account**
  
  The `store` header was previously missing from GraphQL calls.
  
  See `Magento_Review/templates/customer/list.phtml` and `Magento_Review/templates/form.phtml`

- **Orders and Returns for guests now correctly toggles between Email and ZIP code`
  
  Previously, the change event of the "Find Order By" dropdown was handling the wrong event data.
  
  `event.originalTarget.value` was changed into `event.target.value`.
  
  See `Magento_Sales/templates/guest/form.phtml`
  
- **The cart drawer now respects the `display sidebar` setting for minicart**
  
  If `checkout/sidebar/display` is set to `no`, the cart-drawer is no longer loaded.
  
  See `Magento_Theme/layout/default.xml`
  
  Thanks to Rik Willems (RedKiwi) for contributing.

- **The product slider now checks for `visiblity` and `status` of linked products**
  
  Upsells, Cross-sells and Related products are not filtered by graphql on storefront visiblity.
  We therefore added the `visibility` and `status` attributes to the graphql result so that we can filter on them.
  
  See `Magento_Theme/templates/elements/slider.phtml`

- **Escaping was improved in the topmenu**
  
  See `Magento_Theme/templates/html/header/topmenu.phtml`
  
  Thanks to Aad Mathijssen (Isaac) for contributing.

- **Browsersync improvements**
  
  Improvements to browsersync config were made to prevent form-key issues.
  
  Thanks to Javier Villanueva (Media Lounge) for contributing.
     
### Removed
- **`<script>` tags no longer contain the `defer` attribute**
  
  Since these have no effect...

- **Duplicate function declarations in Alpine Components**
  
  For IE11 compatibility we used to declare function names in Alpine init objects with an explicit function name. These have now been removed.
  For example:
  ```
  { addToWishlist: function addToWishlist(productId) { ... } }
  ```
  became:
  ```
  { addTowishList(productId) { ... } }
  ```
